All of our guests were also impressed at the super quality of the food - it was very tempting for me to try and claim that I did the cooking but the standard was so professional that there is no way any amateur could get near. It all helped us to have worry free Christmas and New Year. It is difficult to single out any one dish as they were all memorable but the salmon en croute was particularly special.",
