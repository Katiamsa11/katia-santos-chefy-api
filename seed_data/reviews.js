He looked after everybody really well and the food was terrific. Thanks for setting it all up and you can be assured that if I try this again you will be top of my list.",

The food was delicious especially the scallops and the beef and it was just great to have you around. Francesca carried out her duties wonderfully well - pleasant, efficient and unobtrusive.

      "Pip and I would like to express our sincere thanks and delight at the food you prepared for us over Christmas and New Year. All of our guests were also impressed at the super quality of the food - it was very tempting for me to try and claim that I did the cooking but the standard was so professional that there is no way any amateur could get near. It all helped us to have worry free Christmas and New Year. It is difficult to single out any one dish as they were all memorable but the salmon en croute was particularly special.",

      "was very pleased to find someone near to us who could help us with catering for our 10th wedding anniversary party. The service we received was first class – and the thought and attention beforehand was amazing. The choice of dishes was perfect: spicy nyonya chicken (with lemongrass, chilli, ginger shrimp paste) and lamb baked with yoghurt and black pepper with rice and breads for 100 guests. The sauce on the chicken was fantastic but the overall winner was the lamb. The food contributed greatly to the success for the party and everyone commented on how good it was. Great food, service, people and price.",

The evening went very smoothly and your waitress Amy did a wonderful job in looking after everybody. It was such a treat, especially for me, to be out of the kitchen and enjoying the company of our guests, with the extra win-win bonus of a clean and tidy kitchen at the end of the evening! Thank you for such a terrific evening, and I hope we have occasion to call on your services in the near future.",
